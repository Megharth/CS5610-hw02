## calc.html
This file contains a calculator. It supports chaining of multiple operations such as adding two numbers and then multiplying that number by a third number. But, while chaining the operations, it is mandatory to calculate the answer of each operation by pressing **"+/="** button. Also, the clear button will clear the state and answer of the operation if the answer was calculated. If not, it will just erase the number and u can continue to calculate using different number.
